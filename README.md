 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Understand customer ordering behavior
* Analyze delivery performance
* Explore factors affecting delivery time and order value
* Visualize trends using charts and graphs

This notebook is suitable for "beginners to intermediate learners" in data analysis and data science.



Technologies & Tools Used

*Python 3*
*Google Colab*
*Libraries:*

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn



Key Analysis Performed

* Data loading and inspection
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Statistical summaries
* Visualizations for insights



 How to Run the Notebook (Using Google Colab)

1. Open **Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on **File → Open notebook**
3. Select the **GitHub** tab
4. Paste this repository URL
5. Open `Food_Delivery_Data_Analysis.ipynb`
6. Run the cells sequentially

Alternatively, you can upload the notebook directly to Colab.



 Sample Outputs

The notebook includes:

* Bar charts
* Line plots
* Distribution plots
* Summary tables

These help in understanding food delivery patterns and performance metrics.



 Future Improvements

* Add machine learning models for delivery time prediction
* Include real-time or larger datasets
* Build an interactive dashboard
